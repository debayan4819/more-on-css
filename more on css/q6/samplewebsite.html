            The Indian Navy is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces and one of the largest and most powerful navies in the world. It has a proud history of maritime achievements and a vital role in safeguarding the nation’s security and interests. Here are some facts about the Indian Navy that you might find interesting:
            <ul>
                <li>The Indian Navy traces its origins to the East India Company’s Marine, which was established in 1612 to protect British merchant ships in the region. It was renamed as the Royal Indian Navy in 1934 and became the Indian Navy after India’s independence in 19471</li>
                <li>The Indian Navy has a fleet of about 150 ships and submarines, and 300 aircraft, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, nuclear and diesel submarines, patrol vessels, amphibious ships, and helicopters. It also has various auxiliary and support vessels, such as replenishment oilers, mine countermeasure vessels, and survey ships.</li>
                <li>The Indian Navy operates in the Indian Ocean Region, which covers about 2.5% of the world’s surface area and 66% of the world’s oil trade. It also conducts missions and exercises in other regions, such as the Persian Gulf, the Horn of Africa, the Strait of Malacca, the South and East China Seas, and the Western Mediterranean Sea</li>
                <li>The primary objective of the Indian Navy is to safeguard the country’s maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace. It also works with other navies and international organizations to promote peace, stability, and cooperation in the region and beyond</li>
                <li>The Indian Navy has participated in several wars and operations, such as the Portuguese-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani Wars, the 1971 insurgency in Ceylon, Operation Cactus, Operation Flowers are Blooming, the Kargil War, and the anti-piracy operations in Somalia. It has also been involved in humanitarian missions and disaster relief operations, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic</li>
                <li>The Indian Navy’s motto is “Shaṁ No Varunaḥ”, which means “May the Lord of Water be auspicious unto us” in Sanskrit. The Indian Navy Day is celebrated on December 4 every year to commemorate the Operation Trident, a naval attack on the Karachi harbour during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, in which the Indian Navy used anti-ship missiles for the first time and sank four Pakistani vessels</li>
